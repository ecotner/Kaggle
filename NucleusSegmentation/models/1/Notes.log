- Added data normalization (subtract off mean and divide by standard deviation)
- Added dropout
- Doubled the depth of the network and halved the batch size (to keep memory usage constant)
- Added accuracy and confidence metrics (plotted as error and uncertainty)
- Added progress pic generated at end of epoch
- Added IOU (Intersection Over Union) metric, as that's what the Kaggle competition is graded on
